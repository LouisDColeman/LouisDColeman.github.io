Despite the prevalent myth that insomnia is not a serious problem, there is substantial evidence which shows that untreated and persistent insomnia is associated with&#58;<br><br>&#8226; Reduced quality of life<br>&#8226; Poor work performance<br>&#8226; Increased occurrence of accidents <br>&#8226; Risk for medical illness<br>&#8226; Risk for psychiatric illness<br><br>Fortunately, for the 10 - 20 % of Americans who suffer from insomnia, there is help. Recent advances in Sleep Medicine help the majority of troubled sleepers, often without medication.<br><br><b>WELCOME TO THE SLEEP COUNTER ECOSYSTEM<!--/b><br><br>The app is fully automated and it just works with advanced sleep metrics, automated goal setting and full integration across multiple platforms. While you sleep the app calculates your personal sleep metrics from sleep data recorded using sensors on your phone and/or wearable. Then it compares and analyzes the data using the latest research in sleep actigraphy to your sleep goals to ensure you're getting the best sleep possible. The goals are calculated using the latest in CBT-I modeling and predictions on sleep therapies are made using artificial neural networks or advanced machine learning. The product is fully integrated across android, apple, and windows. You can even view your sleep counter data in Google Fit, S Health, or any web-browser. Welcome to the Sleep Counter ecosystem.<br><br><b>TYPES OF SLEEP PROBELMS TREATED</b><br><br>This app is meant for individuals who have difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or difficulty sleeping on a schedule that allows them to function best in their work.<br><br><b>WHAT WILL HAPPEN</b><br><br>Your sleep will be evaluated using a series of questionnaires by artificial neural networks. You may wish to share the questionnaire with a sleep medicine professional. The questions range from medical history to medical symptoms to sleep disorder symptoms to sleep environment questions. Your sleep medicine professional may wish to conduct an interview. These questions along with the interview will aid in determining the factors that affect your sleep and daytime functioning.<br><br><b>WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT CAN I EXPECT?</b><br><br>For individuals with Primary or Secondary Insomnia, the first line of intervention is usually behavioral. Behavioral treatment is based upon the concept that chronic insomnia (greater than 4 weeks) is maintained by a variety of physical and behavioral factors that have little or nothing to do with acute insomnia (one or two days). The factors that maintain chronic insomnia are the ones targeted for treatment. This treatment is known as CBT-I or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and this app can aid in CBT-I therapy.<br><br>
            Clinical studies have shown that behavioral treatment for insomnia is effective, producing long lasting results that are comparable to or exceed those of sleeping pills.<br><br>
            Five to eight weekly sessions are usually required to get people good sleep and to help them continue sleeping well. Follow-up recommendations are made to ensure that the results are maintained.

            <b>HOW CAN THIS APP HELP ME?</b>
            <br><br>This app should be used in conjunction with CBT-I therapy from a sleep medicine specialist. Answering the questionnaire provided will allow the app to suggest predictive goals that your specialist might recommend to aid you in obtaining better sleep. You may edit these goals if they do not match your sleep specialist recommendations or manually add weekly goals suggested by your sleep specialist.<br><br>Each weekly session will become available as you progress through your treatment. These sessions consist of a reading to educate you on the behaviors and type of therapy that will aid you in getting better sleep and how these therapies work. Once you complete the reading for that week your personal goals for that week will appear with a bedtime that matches the alarm you set for yourself. The sleep diary and graphs will aid you and your specialist in evaluating your progress through the sessions. The sleep graphs, daily and weekly sleep diaries can be shared through email and text with your sleep specialist.<br><br>Better sleep starts today.
