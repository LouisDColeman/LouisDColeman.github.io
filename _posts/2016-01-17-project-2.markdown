description: My Thesis on the Human Lung&#58; Plethysmography, Spirometry, and Inverse Modeling. This thesis uses spirometric and plethysmograph data to determine characteristics and overall health of the lung. Then I used the data to perform modeling and parameter estimation to discern parameters of the lung that traditionally are obtained through invasive procedures.
