description: <p align='left'>Above is a screenshot of me performing model fitting in MatLab and custom GNUPlots I made using the experimental plethysmograph data and predicted data from one of the models.<br><br>I developed a Fortran program using multiple linear regression to perform parameter estimation on plethysmograph data to find pulmonary compliance, inertance, and resistance of a subject's lung using known models, while performing statistical analysis on said models.<br><br><b>Known Models Tested TODO put equations here</b><br>&#8226; Linear Single Compartment<br>&#8226; Linear Multi Compartment<br>&#8226; Nonlinear Single Compartment - Resistance<br>&#8226; Nonlinear Single Compartment - Elastance<br>&#8226; Nonlinear Single Compartment - Viscoelastance<br><br>Then I performed model fitting of the pulmonary system using Matlab.<br><br><b>STEPWISE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL SPECS</b><br>&#8226; Linear<br>&#8226; purequadratic<br>&#8226; quadratic<br><br>Physical models of the lung had three modes of discrimination. The first was whether the model made physical sense &#40;e.g. constitutive parameters are well known and match literature values from experiments&#41;. The second test involved performing statistical analysis on the models. The third concerned seeing how model predictions matched new experimental data.<br><br><b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED</b><br>&#8226; Standard Deviation and Variance<br>&#8226; Coefficient of Determination<br>&#8226; P-Value<br>&#8226; Akaike Information Criterion Corrected<br>&#8226; Root Mean Squared Error<br>&#8226; Adjusted R-Squared<br>&#8226; F-Stat<br></p>
