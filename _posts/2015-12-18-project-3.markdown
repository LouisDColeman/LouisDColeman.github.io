description: I developed a Fortran program using multiple linear regression to perform parameter estimation on plethysmograph data to find pulmonary compliance, inertance, and resistance of a subject's lung using known models. <ul align='left'><li>Linear Single Compartment</li><li>Linear Multi Compartment</li><li>Nonlinear Single Compartment - Resistance</li><li>Nonlinear Single Compartment - Elastance</li><li>Nonlinear Single Compartment - Viscoelastance</li></ul><br>Then I performed model fitting of the pulmonary system using Matlab. Physical models of the lung had three modes of discrimination. The first was whether the model made physical sense &#40;e.g. constitutive parameters are well known and match literature values from experiments&#41;. The second test involved performing statistical analysis on the models. The third concerned seeing how model predictions matched new experimental data.
