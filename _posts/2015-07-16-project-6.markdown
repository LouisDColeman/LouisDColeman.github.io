description: <b>Magnetic Field Dependent Critical Temperature of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub> Superconductor</b><br><br><p align="left"><a href="assets/paper/Coleman_YBCO_Superconductivity.pdf"><b>DOWNLOAD PAPER</b></a><br><br><b>SKILLS USED</b><br><br>&#8226; Reverse engineering <br>&#8226; Advanced product property testing<br>&#8226; Experimentation<br>&#8226; Production analysis <br><br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>The current U.S. power grid generates 4.061 petawatts of power. Roughly 6 % to 8 % of this power is lost using conventional transmission lines. Most of this loss is due to the electron resistance of the conductive material in the power lines. High temperature superconductors (HTS) experience zero DC electron-electron scattering and do not use electrons to carry entropy below a critical temperature (T<sub>c</sub>). Many HTS including YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub> have a critical temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen making it a feasible material to replace current transmission lines by coating tape with the YBCO material. Transmission lines are often bombarded with arbitrary magnetic interference. This interference can lower the critical temperature. Possibly below the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) performs resistance measurements at varying temperatures and magnetic ﬁeld strengths to determine the materials range of critical temperatures<br><br><b>ABSTRACT</b><br><br>Resistance measurements for non-optimally doped YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub> were taken in a randomly oriented orthonormal applied magnetic ﬁeld range of 0 T to 4 T using a Physical Properties Measurement System. At each step increase of the magnetic ﬁeld, the machine down stepped the temperature from 105 K all the way down to 65 K. Normalized resistance graphs were obtained using Igor Pro. From the graphs, the critical temperature range was analyzed to be about 80 K to 90 K for this magnetic ﬁeld range. The critical temperature range determines what refrigerant is needed to transition the material into a superconducting state. This range shows that YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub> can be cooled with the less expensive liquid nitrogen method, rather than liquid hydrogen or helium even under all natural earthly magnetic interference and common man made causes of magnetic interference.<br><br><b>CONCLUSION</b><br><br>The critical temperature for non-optimally doped YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub> across a range of 0 T to 4 T applied magnetic ﬁelds were acquired using a PPMS and analyzed using Igor Pro. The critical temperatures were found to be between 80 K and 90 K for a randomly oriented orthonormal ﬁeld from 0 T to 4 T. The magnetic interference lowered the transition temperature, but never below the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Future experimentation will involve, testing the quality of the sample and varying the angle of the incident ﬁelds to see if we can further save on production cost by utilizing lower grade YBCO material.</p>
